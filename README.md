## Overview

**Roblox Release Tracker** is dedicated to monitoring Roblox release notes with a focus on tracking the status of individual features for each version. Each release (e.g., `release-650`) includes detailed notes where every feature is tagged as either **Pending** or **Live**, providing a clear view of which features are active and which are still under development.

## What’s Tracked

- **Versioned Releases:**  
  Releases follow a standardized format (e.g., `release-650`).

- **Feature Status:**  
  Within each release, individual features are labeled with one of the following statuses:
  - **Pending**
  - **Live**

- **Dual Representations:**  
  For every release version, two files are maintained:
  - A **Markdown file** for a user-friendly display of the release notes and feature statuses.
  - A **JSON file** containing the raw data for integration or further analysis.

## File Structure

Each release version is represented by two separate files, ensuring both readability and ease of data parsing. A typical directory structure looks like this:

```
/releases/
├── release-650.md
├── release-650.json
├── release-649.md
├── release-649.json
└── ...
```

*Note:* Up to six recent versions are tracked at any given time.

## Usage

Browse the repository to check out the latest release notes in Markdown or refer to the JSON files for raw data. Whether you're a developer integrating release information or a fan tracking feature statuses, **Roblox Release Tracker** offers a clear and organized overview of Roblox's evolving feature landscape.
