## Improvements

| Status | Note |
|--------|------|
| ![Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-009E57?style=flat)  | Updates logo for Roblox Studio. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds animation support to <code>Class.AssetService.CreateAssetAsync</code> and <code>Class.AssetService.CreateAssetVersionAsync</code>. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Introduces three-phase rollout for updates to the physics sleep system. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds an explicit error that user defined type functions named "typeof" are not allowed. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds <code>CapabilityControl</code> which allows sandboxed scripts to modify the capabilities and sandboxing of other instances. We also update drules to keep sandboxing safe when these properties are changed. In general, scripts cannot modify capabilities of an instance if the resulting capabilities exceeds their own. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds preset selection to the visual editor for <code>Class.AudioEmitter.DistanceAttenuation</code> and <code>Class.AudioListener.DistanceAttenuation</code>. |

| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | In Luauâ€™s New Type Solver, decreases the occurrence of "leaked free type" errors. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds <code>Class.ImageButton.HoverImageContent</code> and <code>Class.ImageButton.PressedImageContent</code>. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds a method <code>CFrame:angleBetween(cf: CFrame)</code>, used to compute the angle of rotation between two CFrames. This is the minimum angle required to align both rotations of the CFrames together. This function does not take the position of either CFrame into account, and only looks at the relative rotation. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds ragdoll death to the Avatar Joint Upgrade. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds <code>Enum.AudioFilterType.Lowpass6dB</code>, which produces a gentler muffling effect when assigned to an <code>Class.AudioFilter</code>, compared to <code>Enum.AudioFilterType.Lowpass12dB</code>. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | New beta feature: Fast autocompletion with fragment typechecking. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Avatar auto setup no longer uploads models as input. This prevents you from being moderated twice for the same asset. |
