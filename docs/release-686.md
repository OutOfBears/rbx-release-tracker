## Improvements

| Status | Note |
|--------|------|
| ![Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-009E57?style=flat)  | Attributes and tags on instances are now stored more efficiently, decreasing memory pressure. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Improves diffraction pathfinding in the "Acoustic Simulation" beta when emitters or listeners are near obstacles. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | `Class.WrapDeformer\|WrapDeformers` can now be attached under layered clothing meshes, for example `Class.MeshPart\|MeshParts` that have `Class.WrapLayer` children rather than just `Class.WrapTarget` children. The difference between the `Class.WrapDeformer` cage and `Class.WrapLayer` outer cage will deform the mesh prior to any layered clothing fit. Layered clothing `Class.MeshPart\|MeshParts` deformed through `Class.WrapDeformer` can be published as they have been for deformed body part `Class.MeshPart\|MeshParts`. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Updates in-experience convex decomposition to a technique that produces better results in most cases. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds a `Enum.InputActionType.ViewportPosition\|ViewportPosition` action type to the Input Action System. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds the `Enum.AdornShading` enum. Adds Box/Sphere/Cone/Cylinder HandleAdornment property: Shading. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | In the MicroProfiler, adds a new category under X-Ray mode that allows you to view network traffic. Before generating a dump, select a verbosity level in the MicroProfiler overlay "Network" menu. When viewing the dump, select "Network" in the X-Ray menu. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Added `Hollow` property to `Class.ConeHandleAdornment`. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds `Class.GuiService.ViewportDisplaySize` to retrieve physical size (`Enum.DisplaySize`) of the viewport |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adaptive reverb in the beta "Acoustic Simulation" feature has been tweaked and improved slightly. |

| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Adds a new `VideoContent` property to `Class.VideoFrame`. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | In Luau's New Type Solver, types indicative of an internal error no longer leak from modules, and instead raise a type checking error. Previously, this would result in unknown and surprising behavior across different modules. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Fixed a bug in the New Luau Type Solver that would cause type checking to fail on certain patterns of OO-styled code. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Improves the quality of Acoustic Simulation's muffling/filtering. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | `game.CoreGui` and other restricted instances and services will no longer be accessible in scripts which do not have a permission to use them. Instead, attempt to index or retrieve such an instance from Roblox API method will return 'nil'. |

| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | In the New Luau Type Solver, fixes an issue where a `X or Y` expression might erroneously be reported as having the wrong type when returned from a function. |

| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Fixes an issue that could cause the jump button to become deactivated when changing the humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.JumpPower\|JumpPower`. Previously, players would have to release and press the jump button again to reactivate jumping. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Checked function errors in the new Luau Type Solver will warn about erroneous argument usage using 1-indexed positions for the arguments instead of 0-indexed positions |

| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Improve search performance in the Explorer. Broad searches like "is:BasePart" will lag less and specific searches like "MySpecificModel" will complete faster.<br><br>Fix a bug where using Studio with FPS set to 240Hz could cause hangs greater than a second when searching in the Explorer. |
| ![Pending](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pending-DEA517?style=flat)  | Addresses a crash from using the constraint scale slider in the "Visualization Modes" panel on some Windows machines. |
